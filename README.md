# welcome to coding with github copilot ‚ú®

## what is this repository about?
this repository was initially created for a microsoft stu internal event to show our colleagues how easy it is to code with gh copilot, how it feels to develop with an autocomplete on steriods and teach them how to inspire customers to use gh copilot. it's current iteration will be used for a microsoft internal learning event.

    1. microsofties can request access to gh copilot [here](https://repos.opensource.microsoft.com/orgs/MicrosoftCopilot)
    2. everyone else can buy a licence [here](https://copilot.github.com/) (it's free for students + teachers!)
3. setup
    1. option 1: gh codespaces
        1. in this github repository click on code & create codespace on main ![create codespaces on main](./images/on-main.png)

## tasks

### üî• warm-up: playing around with html, css and javascript
1. open the `app/views/index.ejs` file
1. change the background color to a css gradient of your choice
2. add a button to the page
3. add a div that displays a number
4. add an on-click event to the button that increases the number by 1

> tip: if you do not know how to do something, just ask github copilot chat for help :) 

### main tasks: 

#### üßë‚Äçüíª i: input, validation and event handling

1. add an input field for an email address and a "Submit" button to the page
    1. bonus points: center it vertically, add a label and a placeholder
2. add an on-click event to the button that validates the email address
    1. if the email address is valid, display a success message, if the email address is invalid, display an error message
    > tip: use a regular expression to validate the email address

#### ‚úÇÔ∏è ii: write your own scissors, paper, stone game
1. add three buttons to the page
    1. one for scissors, one for paper, one for stone
2. add an on-click event to every button to start a new game
    1. the computer should randomly choose one of the three options
    2. the user should be able to see the computers chouce, the result of the game and the score
    > tip: use a random number generator to let the computer choose one of the three options
3. write tests for your game with all possible outcomes (scissors vs scissors, scissors vs paper, scissors vs stone, paper vs scissors, paper vs paper, paper vs stone, stone vs scissors, stone vs paper, stone vs stone)

#### üêç iii: translate your javascript code to python
1. create a new file in the folder `app` called `game.py`
 > if your codespace asks you if you want to install the python extension, click yes
2. use github copilot to translate your javascript code to python
3. run your python code in the terminal and play the 

### üìù alternative main task (less coding intensive)
1. open the `app/utils.py` file
2. let github copilot chat explain you the code
3. add meaningful comments to the code (rule of thumb for good comments: if you open the file in roundabout 6 months again, they should help you understand the code asap again :))
4. distribute the regular expressions to different functions
5. bonus ‚ú®: write tests for the functions


### üèÜ bonus task (only locally!!): deployment
1. open the az-deploy.sh and create an azure deployment for your app with azure cli
    1. use environment variables for the resource group name, app service plan name, app service name and location
    1. create azure app service
    2. create a linux app service plan
    3. use node 18
    4. deploy your app

## ‚úèÔ∏è how to setup your own github copilot demo    
want to do your own github copilot demo? here are some tips:
1. think about a simple but fitting use case (ask about the used programming languages in advance!)
2. do a dry run and write down the steps you want to show
3. do not get nervous if there are hallucinations, be precise in your prompting
4. be aware if you are using codespaces or your local machine (the behaviour and possibilties might be different)
5. things I usually show:
    1. inline generation of a function
    2. generate deployment script
    3. generate whole html page
    4. let github copilot chat explain a piece of code
    5. let github copilot chat write a test (and explain it)
